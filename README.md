# 📊 Week 3: Energy Efficiency EDA & Visualization (Python + Jupyter)

This project is part of **Week 3** of the **Celebal Summer Internship** program.

The assignment was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using any dataset and present the results with **detailed visualizations**.  
I chose the **Energy Efficiency dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and completed the analysis using **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib** in a **Jupyter Notebook**.

## 📌 Features

- 📥 Excel file loaded directly with `pandas.read_excel()`
- 📊 Full EDA including:
  - Shape, datatypes, summary stats
  - Null checks and data distributions
- 🔍 Feature Engineering:
  - `Total_Load` (Heating + Cooling)
  - Aspect Ratio & Glazing classification
- 🌈 Vibrant visualizations:
  - Histograms, boxplots, pie charts, heatmaps
  - Line plots, scatter plots, KDE plots
  - Pairplots for feature relationships
- 🧠 Insights explained after each major section
- 💾 Final cleaned dataset exported as CSV
